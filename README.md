## Background
---

` There's been a lot of hype in the news lately about cryptocurrency, so I wanted to review the latest news headlines regarding Bitcoin and Ethereum to get a better feel for the current public sentiment around each coin.` 


*In this assignment, I applied natural language processing to understand the sentiment in the latest news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. I also applied fundamental NLP techniques to better understand the other factors involved with the coin prices such as common words and phrases and organizations and entities mentioned in the articles.*



Instructions

### Sentiment Analysis
- I used the newsapi to pull the latest news articles for Bitcoin and Ethereum and created a DataFrame of sentiment scores for each coin.
- I used descriptive statistics to answer the following questions:

1. Which coin had the highest mean positive score?
2. Which coin had the highest negative score?
3. Which coin had the highest positive score?


### Natural Language Processing
In this section, I used NLTK and Python to tokenize text, find n-gram counts, and create word clouds for both coins.



### N-grams
Then I looked at the ngrams and word frequency for each coin.




### Word Clouds
I then generated word clouds for each coin to summarize the news for each coin.
